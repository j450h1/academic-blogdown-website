Jas "like JazzðŸŽº music" is a Data and Applied Scientist at Microsoft based out of Vancouver, Canada. Currently, he is on the OXO Fuel team - focusing on using data to help sustain healthly enterprise customers  (in terms of their usage of MS Office products).

Previously, he spent 5+ years on the modeling team at Cardinal Path - a leading marketing analytics consultancy. He was the 1st employee in the data science department and helped build it from the ground up with a focus on reproducibility. 

At Cardinal Path, he led end to end projects: everything from gathering requirements, to building data pipelines, training machine learning models, and finally visualizing and presenting results. Key clients included Intel, Rite-aid, Cisco, and Universal Music, to name a few. Over the past few years, he has specialized in multi-channel attribution, market mix modeling, and predictive modeling (classification and regression).

Prior to Cardinal Path, Jas worked in sales and supply chain for a leading ecommerce startup, BuildDirect.com technologies. He honed his business acumen and worked with the COO to build up the new Inventory Department. 
He was one of the 1st students to complete the John Hopkins Data Science specialization where he first learned R and built a natural language model (bag of words) to predict what a user would type next. He then completed 7 projects as part of the comprehensive Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program taught by experts from Google, AirBnb and other industry insiders. 

Nearly half a decade later, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, he made the most of his time in lockdown to complete another Udacity program: the [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). As part of the program, he published this [blog post](https://medium.com/swlh/whats-in-a-name-an-analysis-of-over-a-century-of-baby-names-a60c6e1a6615) which the medium curation team recommended to readers interested in Data Science. It was also featured on the main page of their most popular publication, [the Startup](https://medium.com/swlh).

If you haven't noticed yet, Jas is a R ninja (this website was fully built using RStudio), a slick SQLer, and a Python pro. He's also a bit bashful about his brilliant bash scripting skills.

On a more personal note, he's an avid skier, hiker, and a biker. He has recently taken up tennis and beach volleyball.
